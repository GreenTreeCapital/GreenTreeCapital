            <p>
                Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of all capital. Past
                performance is not indicative of future results. Before making any financial
                decisions, you should conduct your own research and consider seeking advice
                from a qualified, regulated professional who is aware of your individual
                situation and objectives.
